* 2.0.5 Release Notes

  The full list of changes can be found in our {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12294&styleName=Text&projectId=10500&Create=Create}
  issue management system}}, and is reproduced below.

** Changes that may affect existing builds

    * {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2794} MNG-2794}} - Maven now behaves in a defined way when matching the nearest dependency when two
      exist at the same depth in the dependency graph, by matching the first encountered. Previously, it was undefined. This may result in some
      builds having a different dependency graph, which could cause failures if all compilation dependencies are not specified completely in the POM.
      While not currently enforced, projects should always list the dependencies it needs to compile, even if they are available transitively.

    * {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2228} MNG-2228}} - The handling of build extensions has changed. This technique causes less pollution to the
      global classloader, allowing them to be used more widely for extensions to Maven's core. This may affect builds that used them to expose extra
      classes to various plugins. While in most scenarios these builds will continue to work, in these situations the <<<\<dependencies\>>>> element of
      <<<\<plugin\>>>> should be used instead.
