* Maven 3.0-beta-1 Release Notes

  Maven 3 aims to ensure backward compatibility, improve usability, increase performance, allow safe embedding, and pave the way
  to implement many highly demanded features.

  Noteworthy changes in this release are the revision of version range to no longer include snapshot versions unless
  explicitly matched by a range boundary (cf. [MNG-3092]) and the support for parallel builds (cf. [MNG-3092]).
  Users that intent to use this feature are strongly advised to read the
  {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Parallel+builds+in+Maven+3} Guide on Parallel Builds}}
  to learn about potential ramifications.
  
  The full list of changes can be found in our {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10500&version=16089}issue management system}}, and is reproduced below.
