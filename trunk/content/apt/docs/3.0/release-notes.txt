* Maven 3.0 Release Notes

  Maven 3 aims to ensure backward compatibility to the extent possible, improve usability, increase performance,
  allow safe embedding, and pave the way to implement many highly demanded features.

  Users that intent to use the new parallel build feature are strongly advised to read the
  {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Parallel+builds+in+Maven+3} Guide on Parallel Builds}}
  to learn about potential ramifications.
  
  The full list of changes can be found in our {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10500&version=13142}issue management system}}, and is reproduced below.

    * [MNG-4811] - Custom Maven Plugin regression in Maven 3.x, custom ComponentConfigurator causes infinite loop

    * [MNG-4814] - Eary dependency resolution attempts for reactor projects prevent their later resolution from the reactor

    * [MNG-4836] - Incorrect recursive expression cycle errors (update plexus-interpolation)

    * [MNG-4837] - Interpolation error due to cyclic expression for one of the POM coordinates gets needlessly repeated

    * [MNG-4842] - [regression] Repositories discovered in dependency POMs override repositories configured for original resolution request of POM

    * [MNG-4845] - [regression] MavenProject.getDependencyArtifact() returns artifacts without version for dependency with version range
