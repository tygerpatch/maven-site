* 2.1.0 Release Notes

  The full list of changes can be found in our {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=14587&styleName=Html&projectId=10500&Create=Create}issue management system}}, and is reproduced below.

** Changes that may affect existing builds.

    * MNG-3600 - The <<<\<server\>>>> element in <<<settings.xml>>> no longer specifies a default value for file and directory modes on remotely deployed files. Please refer to the Settings guides for how to configure this appropriately for your deployment environment.

    * MNG-3475 - neither the script source directory nor the reporting output directory were aligned to the base directory. While this was a bug, if you used an expression such as <<<$\{basedir\}/$\{project.reporting.outputDirectory\}>>> then where this would of worked in Maven 2.0.10, it will have two copies of the project base directory in Maven 2.1.0+. You should remove the leading <<<$\{basedir\}>>> from the expression - however note that in some cases this will cause the build to be incompatible with earlier versions of Maven.

    * MNG-3940 - While environment variables are case-insensitive on Windows, Maven internally stores them in a
      <<<Properties>>> collection. For the time being, the names of environment variables are normalized to all
      upper-case when Maven executes on Windows, thereby at least partly abstracting from different character casing of
      the original variable name. Hence, <<<$\{env.PATH\}>>> will now be reliably resolved on Windows. However, POMs
      that previously used lower-case or mixed-case variable names like <<<$\{env.ProgramFiles\}>>> will need to be
      updated.

    * MNG-4056 - Dependencies specified with a classifier of <<<sources>>> and type of <<<jar>>> are correctly considered source JARs and no longer added to the classpath. This is {{{http://code.google.com/p/gwt-maven/issues/detail?id=200} known to affect the GWT plugin}}

** Noteworthy Changes and improvements  
    
    * MNG-553 - Secure Storage of Server Passwords

    * MNG-3760 - <<<$\{project.baseUri\}>>> has been added as a valid expression in the POM, and is a valid URI equivalent of <<<$\{basedir\}>>>

    * MNG-2576 - Additional switches to the command line for alternate reactor behavior: <<<--resume-from>>>, <<<--also-make>>>, and <<<--also-make-dependents>>>.

    * MNG-3379 - Parallel resolution of dependencies now occurs, with the default number of concurrent of threads set to 5. A configuration option <<<-Dmaven.artifact.threads>>> can be used to change the number of threads.
