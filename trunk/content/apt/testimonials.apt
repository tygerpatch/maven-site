  Keep on going with Maven 2.0 as it really rocks!
  Yesterday, I started experimenting with it and it's such a breeze, I'm
  becoming already productive with Maven, converting our hand-written Ant
  scripts to POM (which means throwing most of the Ant stuff away and
  replacing it with tiny pom.xml files, actually). We have a web
  application consisting of many components which need to be configured
  for different environments and customers. After one day of work
  (including the learning curve) I already have the complete code base
  with >1000 java files in ~20 modules compiling.

  An hour ago or so after I finally got the Castor stuff working I began
  to see just how marvellous Maven works with my multi-module project.
  Seems you guys are able to keep the promises you make in the Maven
  introduction. :-)

  Once again, thanks for creating this great tool!
