Java 5 in Plugins and Components

  When you want to start using Java 5 features in a plugin, or shared component,
  this process must be used as decided by the Maven PMC.
  
  A plugin can start using Java 5 features and/or dependencies when the need
  arises, but if there are issues that have been fixed but not released yet,
  the current trunk of the plugin must be released first, targeting Java 1.4.
  In the announcement for that last Java 1.4 version of the plugin, we inform
  the users that this is the last version that will be able to run on Java 1.4.
  
  When a plugin, or other component, decides to switch to Java 5, you should use
  the description field in JIRA to label the versions for the plugin, so that it
  is clear which version runs on which version of Java. See
  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCHANGES#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Aversions-panel}Maven Changes Plugin}}
  for an example.
