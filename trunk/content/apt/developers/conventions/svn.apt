Maven SVN Convention

 This document describes how developers should use SVN, our SCM.

* Subversion Configuration

 Before committing files in subversion repository, you need to read the
 {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html#https-svn}Committer Subversion Access}}
 document and you must set your svn client with this properties file:
 {{{../../developers/svn-eol-style.txt}svn-eol-style.txt}}

* {Commit Message Template}

  Commits should be focused on one issue at a time, because that makes it easier
  for others to review the commit.

  A commit message should use this template:

+-----+
[ISSUE-1] <<Summary field from JIRA>>
Submitted by: <<Name of non-committer>>

o Comments
+-----+

  Where:

  * <<ISSUE-1>> can be omitted if there was no relevant JIRA issue, though you are strongly encouraged to create one for
  significant changes.

  * <<Submitted by>> only needs to be specified when a patch is being applied for a non-committer.

  * <<Comments>> some optional words about the solution.

  []

eg:

+-----+
[MNG-1456] Added the foo to the bar
Submitted by: Baz Bazman

o Applied without change
+-----+

* Apply User Patch

 By default, the committer should apply the patch without any <<major>> modifications. In a second step, the committer
 could apply any changes as usual.

* Edit Commit Message

 If you want to edit a commit message, you could call:

+-----+
svn pe svn:log --revprop -r XXX
+-----+

 where <<XXX>> is the wanted version

* Other useful Subversion commands while developing

 If you've done a chunk of work and you would like ditch your changes and start from scratch use this command to
 revert to the original checkout:

---
$ svn revert -R .
---

 The <<<-R>>> argument means that the command will recurse down all directories and revert all changes.

 Before committing code to the Subversion repository we always set the <<<svn:ignore>>> property on the directory
 to prevent some files and directories to be checked in. We always exclude the IDE project files and the <<<target/>>>
 directory. Instead of keeping all of the excludes in mind all the time it's useful to put them all in a file and
 reference the file with the <<<-F>>> option:

---
$ svn propset svn:ignore -F ~/bin/svnignore .
---

 An example svnignore file:

---
target
*~
*.log
.classpath
.project
*.ipr
*.iws
*.iml
---
